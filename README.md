# File Structure
- [Figure Reproduction] [plot.ipynb](./plot.ipynb) contains the code to reproduce most of the figures in the same order as in the paper, which uses metadata in the `model_info` folder.
- [Model Fitting and Selection] [gemini.ipynb](./gemini.ipynb), [glm.ipynb](./glm.ipynb), [gpt.ipynb](./gpt.ipynb), [internlm.ipynb](./internlm.ipynb), [qwen.ipynb](./qwen.ipynb), and [human.ipynb](./human.ipynb) fit separate mixed-effects models for each group.
- [Statistical Visualization] [aggregate.ipynb](./aggregate.ipynb) aggregates the results from the individual models for visualization of estimated marginal means (and trends).
- [Power Analysis] [power_analysis.ipynb](./power_analysis.ipynb) performs a post-hoc power analysis to distinguish true null effects from inconclusive insignificant results.
- [Stimuli Metadata] [stimuli_1743457603.csv](./stimuli_1743457603.csv) contains metadata for the stimuli used in the study. Entries with `list_id == -1` are attention checks not used for statistical analysis.
- [All VLM and human responses] [result_1743457603_20250506_20250506F.csv](./result_1743457603_20250506_20250506F.csv) contains all the responses from the VLMs and human participants.
