# Can Vision Language Models Infer Human Gaze Direction? A Controlled Study
The public reproducible analysis code used for the project: Can Vision Language Models Infer Human Gaze Direction? A Controlled Study.

[Preprint link](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/c9xvn)

The [plot.ipynb](./plot.ipynb) notebook contains the code to reproduce the figures in the same order as in the paper, which uses metadata in the `model_info` folder.
Other notebooks ([gemini.ipynb](./gemini.ipynb), [glm.ipynb](./glm.ipynb), [gpt.ipynb](./gpt.ipynb), [internlm.ipynb](./internlm.ipynb), [qwen.ipynb](./qwen.ipynb), and [human.ipynb](./human.ipynb)) are for statistical analysis.
